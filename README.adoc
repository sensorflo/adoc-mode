= adoc-mode

== Introduction

https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] is a text document format for
writing short documents, articles, books and UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files
can be translated to HTML and DocBook markups.

`adoc-mode` is an Emacs major mode for editing AsciiDoc files. It emphasizes on
the idea that the document is highlighted so it pretty much looks like the
final output. What must be bold is bold, what must be italic is italic etc.
Meta characters are naturally still visible, but in a faint way, so they can
be easily ignored.

== Features

Here are some of the main features of `adoc-mode`:

- sophisticated highlighting
- native fontification of code blocks
- toggle between the display of image links and the display of the corresponding images
- promote / demote title
- toggle title type between one line title and two line title
- adjust underline length of a two line title to match title text's length
- goto anchor defining a given id, default reading from xref at point
- support for outline (however only with the one-line title style)

=== Demo

The highlighting emphasizes on how the output will look like. _All_
characters are visible, however meta characters are displayed in a
faint way.  An exception are image links.  You can toggle between
the display of the link text and the linked image.

== Usage

Adoc-mode is designed for intuitive use. Most features are available
from the _AsciiDoc_ menu in the menu bar.

This section only describes some not so obvious features.

=== Image Preview
If you click kbd:[mouse-3] on an image link like
`image⁣:path/to/image[]` the _Image_ context menu pops up.

This context menu allows you to generate or remove the preview for
the linked image.

The menu item _AsciiDoc → Toggle display of images_ runs the command
`adoc-toggle-images`. It removes all image previews from the buffer
if there are any. If there are no image previews in the buffer it
generates them for all image links.

This may be confusing if all image previews are outside the visible
region of the buffer. In this case, you might expect `adoc-toggle-images`
to generate the previews for the image links in the visible area on
the first run. But it does not, since it first removes all the
previews, even if you have not seen them.

Just run `adoc-toggle-images` again if it does not what you expect on
the first run.

== Installation

`adoc-mode` is available on the community-maintained
link:{melpa-stable-package}[MELPA Stable] and link:{melpa-package}[MELPA] repos.

Using MELPA Stable is recommended as it has the latest stable version.
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run `adoc-mode` from a git checkout.

You can install `adoc-mode` using the following command:

kbd:[M-x] `package-install` kbd:[RET] `adoc-mode` kbd:[RET]

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

kbd:[M-x] `package-refresh-contents`

Alternative, you can add something like this to your Emacs config:

[source,emacs-lisp]
----
(unless (package-installed-p 'adoc-mode)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'adoc-mode))
----

or if you're into `use-package`:

[source,emacs-lisp]
----
(use-package adoc-mode
  :ensure t)
----

== Configuration

=== General

According to an old AsciiDoc manual, `.txt` is the standard file extension of
AsciiDoc files. Add the following to your initialization file to open all `.txt`
files with adoc-mode as major mode automatically:

[source,emacs-lisp]
----
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons "\\.txt\\'" 'adoc-mode))
----

Modern conventions for AsciiDoc file extensions favor `.adoc` and
`.asciidoc` and they are associated with `adoc-mode` automatically.

You can see a list of all configuration options offered by `adoc-mode` by running the following command - kbd:[M-x] `customize-group adoc`.

=== Native Syntax Highlighting of Source Code Blocks

Out-of-the-box `adoc-mode` will try to apply native font-locking to source code blocks (e.g. the same font-locking that `ruby-mode` would use for Ruby code blocks).
This can be tweaked by several configuration options:

* Native fontification of source blocks can be switched off by setting `adoc-fontify-code-blocks-natively` to `nil`.
* Native fontification of lengthy code blocks can cause performance problems. If the value of `adoc-fontify-code-blocks-natively` is an integer only those code blocks are fontified natively whose length is less or equal to that value.
* To avoid performance problems with code block beginnings that do not have a matching end yet the scanning for the code block end is delimited by `adoc-font-lock-extend-after-change-max`.
* All programming languages `XYZ` that have an Emacs major mode `XYZ-mode` and use `font-lock` are automatically supported. Some other languages not fitting into that name scheme are supported through the alist `adoc-code-lang-modes`. You can add your own languages and modes there if they work based on `font-lock` and are not automatically supported.
* The fall-back language mode is `prog-mode` without any fontification. You can set your own default by `adoc-fontify-code-block-default-mode`.

=== Display of Image Previews

Images are shown as preview by default when you open an AsciiDoc file.
You can avoid this by deactivating the option `adoc-display-images`.

The maximal size for the preview of images can be set by `adoc-max-image-size`.

An image link can also be given as url to a remote image. The display of remote images is switched off by default. You can activate it by the option `adoc-display-remote-images`.
Thereby, images are only downloaded if the protocol of the url matches one of those in the list `adoc-remote-image-protocols`. This list can be customized. By default, it only contains the entry `https`.
=== Syntax Highlighting Customization

It is possible to customize the way `adoc-mode` renders different text
elements (faces) like section titles, text or punctuation styles. For
example, if you would like a level 1 section title to have a different
text color or height you can achieve this by using standard Emacs
functionality.

First of all, list all available faces by running

kbd:[M-x] `list-faces-display`

and searching for lines with the `adoc-` prefix.

Alternatively, you can get information about the face under point by calling

kbd:[M-x] `describe-face`

One possible solution to change the look of a face is to use the
built-in `use-package` feature `:custom-face`.

Example:

[source,emacs-lisp]
----
(use-package adoc-mode
  :ensure t
  :custom-face
  (adoc-title-0-face ((t (:height 1.0 :weight bold)))))
----

Of course, this is only one way to do it. Emacs has a few ways to
customize faces. Simply, pick the one you prefer.

If your default face is a fixed pitch (monospace) face, but in AsciiDoc files
you liked to have normal text with a variable pitch face, `buffer-face-mode`
is one good options for you:

[source,emacs-lisp]
----
(defun my-buffer-face-mode-variable ()
   "Set font to a variable width (proportional) fonts in current buffer."
   (interactive)
   (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:family "DejaVu Sans" :height 100 :width semi-condensed))
   (buffer-face-mode))

(add-hook 'adoc-mode-hook (lambda() (buffer-face-mode t)))
----

== Roadmap

Here are some features that we're considering to add in the future:

- Demote / promote for list items
- Outline support also for two line titles
- Correctly highlighting backslash escapes

Check out the issue tracker for more details.

== Hacking

adoc-mode uses https://github.com/doublep/eldev[Eldev] for development, so
you should install the tool first.

The easiest and "purest" way to run adoc-mode is to execute:

    $ eldev emacs

This will start a separate Emacs process with adoc-mode and its
dependencies available, but _without_ your normal packages installed.
However, you can use `Eldev-local` to add some packages with
`(eldev-add-extra-dependencies 'emacs ...)` forms.  See Eldev
documentation for details.

Alternatively, if you want to load adoc-mode from source code in the Emacs
you use for editing:

- Generate autoloads file (that's done automatically when installing
via `package.el` but you'll have to do it manually in this case):

[source,shellsession]
----
$ eldev build :autoloads
----

- Add to your `.emacs`:

[source,emacs-lisp]
----
;; load adoc-mode from its source code
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/adoc-mode")
(load "adoc-mode-autoloads" t t)
----

=== Changing the code

It's perfectly fine to load adoc-mode from `package.el` and then to start making
experiments by changing existing code and adding new code.

A very good workflow is to just open the source code you've cloned and start
evaluating the code you've altered/added with commands like `C-M-x`,
`eval-buffer` and so on.

Once you've evaluated the new code, you can invoke some interactive command that
uses it internally or open a Emacs Lisp REPL and experiment with it there. You
can open an Emacs Lisp REPL with `M-x ielm`.

You can also quickly evaluate some Emacs Lisp code in the minibuffer with `M-:`.

=== Running the tests

Run all tests with:

[source,shellsession]
----
$ eldev test
----

NOTE: Tests may not run correctly inside Emacs' `shell-mode` buffers. Running
them in a terminal is recommended.

You can also check for compliance with a variety of coding standards in batch mode (including docstrings):

[source,shellsession]
----
$ eldev lint
----

To check for byte-compilation warnings you can just compile the project with Eldev:

[source,shellsession]
----
$ eldev compile
----

== History

`adoc-mode` was created by https://github.com/sensorflo/[Florian Kaufmann] in 2009. Eventually the development
was halted in 2016 and the mode was dormant for the next 6 years. In 2022
https://github.com/TobiasZawada[Tobias Zawada] encouraged the Emacs community to revive the development and after a brief period under the https://github.com/emacsorphanage[Emacs Orphanage] org, https://github.com/bbatsov/[Bozhidar Batsov] assumed the project's maintenance.

These days all upstream packages (e.g. on MELPA) are build from Bozhidar's fork.
